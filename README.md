# gnome46-my-theme
Personal light theme for Gnome 46

This is an attempt to use a middle gray colour as base colour with Gnome 46. It is more easy to my eyes. In addition, a blue 1px border has been added to any gtk4 and gtk3 window. Just copy the gtk.css files in the .config/gtk-4.0 and config/gtk-3.0 folder, and launch/relaunch any application (also those working in background). I've used the same solution for the shell, adding a border to almost any dialogs and popups: just copy the folder gnome-shell in .themes/NEW_FOLDER_YOU_WANT and select it from tweaks-gnome (the extension user themes must be installed).

All those files used for this theme are simple text files, so they can be modified easily to match everyone's needs, but this customization is not intended to diverge to much from adwaita light theme.
